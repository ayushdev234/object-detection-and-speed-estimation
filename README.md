# object-detection-and-speed-estimation
Uses YOLO v8 for vehicle detection to local bus stand to keep s surveillance on vehicle and their accounting and speed detection

## Problem Statement

This project focuses on implementing an object detection and tracking system using YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection and Deep SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) for vehicle tracking. The specific application is for monitoring and managing traffic at a local bus stand. The primary objectives include:

1. **Object Detection:** Detecting vehicles in real-time using YOLO-based object detection.
2. **Object Tracking:** Implementing Deep SORT to track the detected vehicles across frames.
3. **Local Bus Stand Implementation:** Adapting the system for monitoring and managing traffic at a local bus stand.
4. **Comparison:** Evaluating the performance of the model trained on a custom dataset versus a pre-trained model.
